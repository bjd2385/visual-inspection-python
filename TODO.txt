TODO:

    1) Expand support to V8.
    2) Expand support to V9.
    3) Implement logging.
        3.1) Implement a restore command so that in case an evaluator needs to reboot their computer, etc., they can,
             quite simply, continue where they left off.
    4) Compile the module to a Windows executable with PyInstaller.
    5) Refine SN ranges.
    6) Add the ability during the visual inspection to add parts by part number at any point (which could, in practice, make answering any questions unnecessary)
    7) Add a command to stop the visual inspection at certain points (might be a good idea to prompt the evaluator and tell them this is a possibility)
        7.1) Isn't it possible to just make each section a stopping point past "immediateInterior" ?
    8)
